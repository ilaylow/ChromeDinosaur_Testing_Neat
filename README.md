# Testing the NEAT Algorithm with Chrome's Dinosaur Game
This project was a simple attempt at experimenting with the NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) Algorithm in Python through the Dinosaur Chrome Game.

**Disclaimer: Most of the code within this repository is adapted from the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKFCIzPSBjE&ab_channel=CodeBucket**
**The code in this repository makes notable changes to some areas, including the extended functionality of exporting the best genome as well as the crouching function of the Dinosaur**

The NEAT algorithm can be defined as an algorithm that continuously generates neural networks of succeeding generations. 
It's a very popular choice when trying to develop an AI to perform simple tasks through multiple trial and errors of the task.

The GIF below displays how a neural network with two hidden layers functions.
